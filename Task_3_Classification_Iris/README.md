Task 3: Iris Classification
Overview

This task involves building classification models to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). Two models were implemented:

Decision Tree Classifier

Logistic Regression Classifier

The project demonstrates basic data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python and scikit-learn.

Dataset

The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset from scikit-learn, containing 150 samples across 3 species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Features include:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)
