Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
Overview

This task involves building a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). Only Logistic Regression is implemented, demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python and scikit-learn.

Dataset

The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset from scikit-learn, containing 150 samples across 3 species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Features include:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Notebook

Libraries Used

Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib / seaborn
